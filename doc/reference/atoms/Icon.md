# Icon
Icons are used to visually communicate core parts of the product and
available actions. They can act as wayfinding tools to help users more
easily understand where they are in the product, and common interaction
patterns that are available.

*Note:* To use Icons, you need to wrap everything in a **ResourceProvider**
