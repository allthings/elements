# What is this about?
Elements is a set of **carefully crafted, high quality React UI components,** that Allthings uses to build their mobile app.
 
We use the [Atomic Design approach](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) to structure everything.

Components are crafted for reusability, composiblity and ease of use.
So it's all about Atoms 👩🏻‍🔬👨🏼‍🔬, Molecules, Organisms and how they React. 🎉
