## Installation

Elements are available on [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@allthings/elements).

```sh
yarn add @allthings/elements
```

Please note that `@allthings/elements` is still under heavy development.

## Usage

Here is a quick example to get you started, it's all you need:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import Button from '@allthings/elements/molecules/Button'

function App() {
  return <Button>Hello World</Button>
}

render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'))
```

### Notes:

**fetch**

`@allthings/elements` uses `fetch` and expects it to be globally available. For example [`cross-fetch`](https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch) can be used at the entry point of the app:

```
import 'cross-fetch/polyfill'
```

## Documentation

## Writing unit tests

Whenever you create or edit a React component or any other JavaScript file, you must update or create a corresponding test file in the same directory.

By convention the test file should be named after the file's name with an additional `.test.` part:

```sh
SomeDir
  | - MyButton.jsx
  | - MyButton.test.jsx
```

```sh
SomeOtherDir
  | - utils.js
  | - utils.test.js
```

To manually trigger the unit tests, run:

```sh
yarn test
```

You can also use the corresponding watch task:

```sh
yarn watch:test
```

The unit tests are performed using the [Jest platform](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), please refer to its documentation.

React component testing is based on the [Enzyme testing utility](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/), please refer to its documentation.

The use of snapshots generated by the `toMatchSnapshot()` method is strongly encouraged. [Those snapshots must be always commited as they are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html)


## Release a new version

``` sh
yarn version 5.0.0-beta.XY
yarn release
```
