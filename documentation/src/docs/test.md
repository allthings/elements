# Button

Buttons make common actions immediately visible and easy to perform with one
click or tap. They can be used for any type of action, including navigation.

---

## Purpose

Think about the merchant problem this component solves when you’re using it:

### Problem

An action needs to be completed by a merchant.

### Solution

The button component can be used to help merchants find and complete actions across Shopify.

---

## Best practices

Buttons should:

* Be clearly and accurately labeled.
* Lead with strong, actionable verbs.
* Use established button colors appropriately. For example, only use a red
button for an action that’s difficult or impossible to undo.
* Prioritize the most important actions. Too many calls to action can cause
confusion and make merchants unsure of what to do next.
* Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.

## Content guidelines

Buttons should be clear and predictable—merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive a merchant by mislabeling a button.

<!-- usagelist -->
#### Do
- Create order
- Buy shipping label

#### Don’t
- New order
- Buy
<!-- end -->

Buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages
action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on
buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.

<!-- usagelist -->
#### Do
- Activate Apple Pay
- View shipping settings

#### Don’t
- Try Apple Pay
- View your settings
<!-- end -->

Buttons should be scannable—avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<!-- usagelist -->
#### Do
Add menu item

#### Don’t
Add a menu item
<!-- end -->

## Examples

### Basic button

Used most in the interface. Only use another style if a button requires more or less visual weight.

```jsx
<Button>Add product</Button>
```

### Outline button

Use against shaded or colorful backgrounds. An outline button will maintain the appropriate visual weight and won’t clash with the background color.

```jsx
<Button outline>Add product</Button>
```

### Plain button

Use for less important or less commonly used actions since they’re less prominent. For example, plain buttons are used as secondary actions in card headers.

```jsx
<Button plain>View shipping settings</Button>
```

### Primary buttons

Use to highlight the most important actions in any experience. Don’t use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming merchants.

```jsx
<Button primary>Save theme</Button>
```

### Destructive buttons

Use when the action will delete merchant data or be otherwise difficult to recover from. Destructive buttons should trigger a confirmation dialog before the action is completed. Be thoughtful about using destructive buttons because they can feel stressful for merchants.

```jsx
<Button destructive>Delete theme</Button>
```

### Slim buttons

Use when a table or list has a set of actions on each item to avoid making items taller than they need to be. Don’t use slim buttons for primary actions.

```jsx
<Button size="slim">Save variant</Button>
```

### Large buttons

Use for the main call to action in empty states or for calls to action shown with large illustrations.

```jsx
<Button size="large">Create store</Button>
```

### Full-width buttons

Use for buttons placed in a narrow column (especially when stacking multiple buttons) or for creating a set of buttons of equal width. Full-width buttons should rarely exceed 320 px wide.

```jsx
<Button fullWidth>Add customer</Button>
```

### Disabled state

Use for actions that aren’t currently available. The surrounding interface should make it clear why the button is disabled and what needs to be done to enable it.

```jsx
<Button disabled>Buy shipping label</Button>
```

### Loading state

Use when a button has been pressed and the associated action is in progress.

```jsx
<Button loading>Save product</Button>
```
